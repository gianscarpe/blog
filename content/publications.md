#### Introduction {#introduction}

Can computer see like we humans do? Computer vision is a joint branch of machine
learning, statistics, and computer science. It's main goal is providing
artificial agents (e.g., robots, autonomous cars, drones, surveilling systems)
the ability to **see** and **understand** the environment. Deep learning and machine
learning are contributing enormeously to computer vision. Open-source
implementations of the recent literature (e.g., torchvision, tensorflow,
recently opencv) demonstrate that deep learning applications are mature and
ready for industrial applications (#TODO: add examples). The Figure below is an
(abused) example of how fast the community has grown during the past
decade. Today, artificial agent perform better than human on huge set of
classes.
